**Write a function**: <br/>

An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day.<br/>

It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. <br/>

A leap year contains a leap day. <br/>

In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years: <br/>

The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless: <br/>
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless: <br/>
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year. <br/>
This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years. 

```python
def is_leap(year):
    leap = False
    
    if year % 400 == 0:
        leap = True
    elif year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 !=0:
        leap = True
    # Write your logic here
    
    return leap

year = int(input())
print(is_leap(year))
```

**Print Function**: <br/>

The included code stub will read an integer, n, from STDIN.<br/>

Without using any string methods, try to print the following: <br/>

123..n <br/>

Note that "..." represents the consecutive values in between. <br/>

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    print(*range(1,n+1),sep="")
```
