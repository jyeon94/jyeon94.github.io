**Employee Salaries**: <br/>

Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) for employees in Employee having a salary greater than <br/>
$2000 per month who have been employees for less than 10 months. Sort your result by ascending employee_id.

Oracle

```sql
select name
from Employee
where salary > 2000 and
         months < 10;
```

**Type of Triangle**: <br/>

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table: <br/>
 Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length. <br/>
 Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length. <br/>
 Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths. <br/>
 Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle. 

```sql
SELECT CASE             
            WHEN A + B > C AND B + C > A AND A + C > B THEN
                CASE 
                    WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
                    WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
                    ELSE 'Scalene'
                END
            ELSE 'Not A Triangle'
        END
FROM TRIANGLES;
```

**The PADS**: <br/>

Generate the following two result sets: <br/>
1.Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). <br/>
  For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S). <br/>

2.Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

```sql
select name || '('  || substr(occupation,1,1) || ')' from occupations order by name;


select 'There are a total of ' || count(occupation) || ' ' || lower(occupation) || 's.' 
from occupations
group by occupation
order by count(occupation),occupation;
```
