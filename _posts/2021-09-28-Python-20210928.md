**Find the Runner-Up Score!**: <br/>

Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. <br/>
You are given n scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(set(arr))
    arr.sort()
    print(arr[-2])
```

**Nested Lists**: <br/>

Given the names and grades for each student in a class of N students, <br/>
store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade. <br>
**Note**: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line. <br/>

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    lst = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        name = input()
        score = float(input())
        lst.append([name,score])
    sec_highest = sorted(set([score for name,score in lst]))[1]
    print('\n'.join(sorted([name for name,score in lst if score == sec_highest])))    
```

**Finding the percentage**: <br/>

The provided code stub will read in a dictionary containing key/value pairs of name:[marks] for a list of students. <br/>
Print the average of the marks array for the student name provided, showing 2 places after the decimal.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    student_marks = {}
    for _ in range(n):
        name, *line = input().split()
        scores = list(map(float, line))
        student_marks[name] = scores
    query_name = input()
    lst = student_marks[query_name]
    print("{:.2f}".format(sum(lst)/len(lst)))

```
