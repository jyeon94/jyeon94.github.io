**Arithmetic Operators**: <br/>

The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where: <br/>

1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers. <br/>
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).<br/>
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

Oracle

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a+b)
    print(a-b)
    print(a*b)
```

** Division**: <br/>

The provided code stub reads two integers,  and , from STDIN. <br/>

Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,  // . The second line should contain the result of float division,  / . <br/>

No rounding or formatting is necessary. <br/>

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a//b)
    print(a/b)
```

**Loops**: <br/>

The provided code stub reads and integer n, , from STDIN. For all non-negative integers i < n, print i^2 .

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(0,n):
        print(pow(i,2))

```
